Q: What is style_strength_schedule?
A: Here`s what I know about style_strength_schedule ( style strength schedule ) or what it`s used for:
Diffusion (style) strength. Actual number of diffusion steps taken (at 50 steps with 0.3 or 30% style strength you get 15 steps, which also means 35 0r 70% skipped steps). Inverse of skep steps. Use list format like [0.5,0.35], where each element corresponds to a frame, last element being repeated forever, or dictionary like {0:0.5, 20:0.35} format to specify keyframes only.
