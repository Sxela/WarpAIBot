Q: How to disable model offload?
A: Please navigate to the GUI -> misc tab and uncheck offload_model to disable model offload. Tick it back in to enable model offload.

Disabling model offload may result in a speedup at a cost of more VRAM usage.
Offloading model is placing it to CPU when it's not being used, and places it back onto the GPU when it's being used, resulting in lover VRAM usage at a cost of a delay.
